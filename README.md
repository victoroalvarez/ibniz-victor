## About
Hi, this is a personal project where I collect diferent code snippets which serve as examples of how to create video animations with IBNIZ, a demo making tool.
I also share notes and comments about working with IBNIZ to produce glitch art and animations.

## Production
I focus on producing glitch art and animations without audio with IBNIZ, and as so, this code snippets are discovered rather than designed, as I usually enter random alphanumeric characters and then remove characters than aren't operators or numbers. I plan to combine this snippets into full demos. I also take existing working examples and produce new snippets.

### No music
I avoid to produce music with IBNIZ on purpose as I don't uderstand how to do it. I mute my computer audio and focus on producing animations.
